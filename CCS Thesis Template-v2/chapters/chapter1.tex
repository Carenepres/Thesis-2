\section{Background of the Problem}
Motorbike accidents have been steadily increasing worldwide, leading to severe injuries and fatalities. One major contributing factor is the lack of helmet compliance and the dangerous practice of triple riding. In India alone, over 37 million individuals own and operate two-wheelers, making it critical to implement an effective monitoring system to enforce safety regulations and reduce accidents. A webcam is used for real-time video input, capturing and processing images to detect violations. The trained neural network then analyzes the webcam input, providing output based on the learned data. The system achieves an estimated 70\% accuracy, with future improvements aimed at enhancing detection precision and real-time performance.\cite{Maddi2023}. Many motorcyclists frequently violate traffic rules by not wearing helmets, and enforcement by traffic police is often limited due to the demanding nature of manual monitoring. This automated helmet detection prototype has the potential to enhance traffic law enforcement and reduce human intervention, leading to safer road environments \cite{Godbole2024}.


The requirement for ongoing surveillance, particularly in busy locations or along lengthy stretches of road, exacerbates this problem. The safety of motorcycle riders is directly put at risk by the ineffectiveness of the enforcement procedures. The creation of an automated, vision-based safety identification and monitoring that can precisely identify the presence or absence of helmets in real-time is required to solve this issue \cite {Kumar2023}. Given the significant portion of traffic-related fatalities attributed to motorcycle accidents resulting from non-compliance with helmet regulations. Acknowledging the critical role of helmets in rider protection, this paper presents an innovative approach to helmet violation detection using deep learning methodologies \cite{Said2024}.


Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn from large amounts of data. In automatic helmet detection, deep learning models are trained using large datasets of helmet-wearing and non-helmet-wearing people. The neural networks learn to recognize the features that distinguish helmet-wearing one from non-helmet-wearing one . Once trained, the deep learning model can be used to automatically detect whether one is wearing a helmet or not \cite{Thakur2024}.


Motorcycle-related accidents have become a growing concern worldwide, significantly contributing to road injuries and fatalities. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 1.35 million people die annually due to road crashes, with motorcycle riders being among the most vulnerable. One of the leading causes of these accidents is the failure to wear helmets, which serve as a critical protective measure against head injuries. Despite laws mandating helmet use, non-compliance remains a widespread issue, exacerbated by weak enforcement and inadequate monitoring. In the Philippines, motorcycle accidents have significantly increased over the years, making it one of the leading causes of road fatalities. According to the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), in 2022, motorcycle-related accidents accounted for more than 30\% of road crash incidents in Metro Manila alone, resulting in severe injuries and fatalities and reported a 17.3 percent increase in motorcycle-related road crashes in 2023. Based on the data from its Road Safety Unit, the MMDA said that a total of 26,599 motorcycle-related crashes were recorded in 2022 \cite{MMDA2023}.


Republic Act No. 10054, also known as the Motorcycle Helmet Act of 2009, mandates that all motorcycle riders and their passengers wear standard protective helmets while on the road. This law aims to reduce head injuries and fatalities by ensuring that helmets meet specific safety standards. Despite the implementation of Republic Act No. 10054, also known as the Motorcycle Helmet Act of 2009, which mandates all motorcycle riders to wear standard protective helmets, many riders continue to violate this law, leading to preventable deaths \cite{Republic2009}.


A major challenge in enforcing helmet compliance is the reliance on manual monitoring by law enforcement officers, which is often inconsistent and inefficient. Traditional methods such as road checkpoints and manual inspections require significant resources and are prone to human error. Moreover, with the increasing number of motorcyclists on the road, it has become nearly impossible for authorities to monitor helmet compliance effectively. The absence of a scalable and automated monitoring system contributes to the ongoing problem, creating a need for technological solutions that ensure stricter enforcement of traffic laws.With advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision, deep learning technologies have emerged as powerful tools for automating helmet compliance detection. Deep learning, a subset of AI, enables machines to process vast amounts of visual data, recognize patterns, and make accurate classifications. Technologies such as YOLO (You Only Look Once), OpenCV, and TensorFlow allow for real-time helmet detection with high precision, making them ideal for traffic monitoring applications. These technologies have been widely implemented in smart surveillance systems for vehicle detection, passenger counting and now, helmet compliance monitoring.


To address the limitations of manual enforcement, this research proposes the development of a Helmet Compliance Detection prototype using computer vision and deep learning algorithms to automatically detect whether motorcycle riders are wearing helmets correctly. The prototype focuses on enhancing helmet compliance monitoring through several key features. It can accurately determine if a rider is properly wearing a helmet on their head and not just carrying it,  it will  also verify if the helmet is securely fastened and correctly positioned.  Helmets can generally be classified into several categories based on their structure and intended use. The prototype will concentrate on the standard motorcycle helmet, which covers the entire head and includes a chin strap and often a visor. This type of helmet offers the most protection and is typically required by law in many regions. The prototype also includes helmet classification by vehicle type, ensuring that riders wear the appropriate helmets corresponding to their vehicles. For example, motorcycle helmets for motorcycles, bicycle helmets for bicycles, and helmets designed for e-bikes for e-bike riders. This helps prevent the use of improper or mismatched helmets, which are flagged as violations to promote stricter adherence to safety standards.
Moreover, the prototype enforces passenger limits by counting riders to ensure no more than two people are on a motorcycle at any time, any overloading is automatically flagged as a violation. Upon detecting any violations,  a red warning is displayed on the system monitor, and the prototype automatically saves short video clips as evidence, supporting authorities in tracking and penalizing repeat offenders. By integrating these features, the prototype aims to improve road safety, assist law enforcement in effectively implementing helmet laws, and ultimately reduce motorcycle-related accidents and fatalities.


\section{Statement of the Problem}


Many motorcycle riders do not follow helmet laws, which can lead to a high risk of accidents, serious injuries, or even death. Traffic officers currently face challenges in manually checking whether motorcycle riders are wearing helmets, as the process is time-consuming and requires significant effort. Since officers cannot monitor every rider, many violations go unnoticed, making the enforcement of helmet laws difficult. Identifying helmet usage under various conditions will be a challenge for the proposed prototype. In poor lighting such as at night or in dark areas the prototype may struggle to clearly identify the rider’s head. Similarly, in adverse weather conditions like fog or heavy rain, recognizing helmets will be difficult. When there are large numbers of motorcycles, it will be hard to check if each rider is wearing a helmet. Because of these challenges, the proposed prototype will need to be tested to ensure it can accurately detect helmets and provide reliable results. It will be evaluated under different conditions such as varied weather and lighting. Its speed and real-time detection performance must also be assessed to ensure it will be reliable in supporting road safety efforts.

\section{Scope and Limitation}


This study will aim to develop and implement an AI-based prototype that uses YOLOv8 with TensorFlow for detecting motorcycles, e-bikes, and bicycles, as well as helmet usage. OpenCV will be used for real-time video and image processing, and the prototype will identify whether riders are wearing helmets properly. In addition, it will count the number of passengers on each vehicle to ensure compliance with road regulations, particularly limiting motorcycle passengers to two. The prototype will be deployed along Nabua Highway. The implementation will involve capturing real-time video through strategically placed surveillance cameras. The captured data will be processed using a Raspberry Pi 4 or NVIDIA Jetson Nano, running the trained YOLOv8 model to detect safety violations.


The prototype’s outputs including flagged violations such as no helmet, improper helmet use, or overloading will be stored as video clips for review by authorities. These outputs will be used to support law enforcement in improving road safety and compliance. However, the prototype has limitations. It will only function effectively in areas covered by surveillance cameras. Its accuracy may decline in low-light or adverse weather conditions such as rain or fog. Recognizing helmet types and differentiating among similar vehicle types (e.g., between bicycles, e-bikes and motorcycles) may introduce errors. The prototype will not be connected directly to enforcement systems during the pilot implementation phase and will initially function as a standalone prototype. Future integrations may include cloud-based databases, vehicle registration systems, and mobile alert features for violations.
